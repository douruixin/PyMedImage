# PyMedImage
This is a library written in Python 3.x and CUDA for common tasks when dealing with the DICOM medical image format in a research setting. 
## Overview
Key features include:
* Easy I/O of dicom images/volumes commonly used in storage of CT, MR, and PET images.
* Reading and conversion of Radiotherapy contours/masks from .rtstruct file to 2D/3D binary masks.
* Patch-based (local) image feature calculation including:
  * 1st Order Statistics
  * Gray Level Co-Occurence Matrices (GLCM)
  * Gray Level Run-Length Matrices (GLRLM)
  * Wavelet Decomposition
  * Customizable Haar-Like features
* GPU-Acceleration and Multi-process management
* Customizable Logging Utilities
* Image-feature-based voxel clustering

## Upcoming Changes/Enhancements
PyMedImage will be updated periodically when time permits to become more functional and robust. Please stay tuned.
